## Who am I?
Hi! I’m Sandip Roy a passionate and creative developer with a love for building web and software solutions. I specialize in front-end and back-end development, using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and Java.
I enjoy turning ideas into real-world applications, solving problems with code, and constantly learning new technologies. My goal is to create projects that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing.
When I’m not coding, I love exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, and improving my skills every day.
